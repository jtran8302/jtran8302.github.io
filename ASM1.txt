Hello there,

My name is Quang Hung Tran but everyone call me Jake and it is my preferred name anyways. Born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. But nobody calls it Ho Chi Minh City because it is a lengthy name. Instead, most of people like to call it Saigon since it is familiar and shorter. 

The picture below is a picture of my sibling's dog. His name is Sherlok (without a C) and I love him and hate his gut at the same time. I love him because he is such an introverted dog. While he is a Saluki, a cousin to the Greyhound breed and is way larger than a Greyhound, he spends most of this time sleeping. I hate his gut because he does not care anyone but its owner, even as someone who takes care majority of his wellbeing and comfort.


Jake.
